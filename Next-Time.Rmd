# For Next Time

For next time, please ask yourself precisely how you will be using R in your workflow and, when you register, enter the specific things you need to know to be able to accomplish your goals.  
And finally, if you havenâ€™t already, consider joining the CHOP R User Group, where you will find cookies (the edible ones), coffee, conversations, presentations, and help with your code. We have a newsletter to announce upcoming gatherings (usually held semimonthly) and an active slack user group.
